README for tlint-0.1.2, the Text Linux Installation Tool 
========================================================

I just wanted to have something like glint for console mode.  So I wrote 
tlint -- just a frontend to rpm.  

This is the very second ALPHA release of tlint.

Requirements:

  rpm (Red Hat package manager) based system (such as Red Hat Linux
    distribution)
    
  glibc2 (for getline and getdelim functions)
  
  newt library
  
  /bin/rpm itself to do all the work

Installation:

  Type `make' to compile it.  Then type `./tlint' to run it.  I would not
  recommend copying to /usr/bin -- wait for a more complete release.
  
  A precompiled version is included (compiled on Red Hat 5.0 system with
  glibc2).

Cacheing:

  It takes some time every time to scan available packages.  However you can
  you can build a list for them for faster access:

    getavail > available
    
  and run tlint with these parameters
  
    tlint -L available
    
  Voila -- no more slow scanning.  You could do the same with installed
  packages (getlist and option -l), but it might be unpractical -- you
  would have to manually update the list every time you install/remove 
  a package (and not forget to do that!).
  
  BTW the only way to specify `available' packages from different directories
  currently is to create a list file:
  
    getavail dir1 > available
    getavail dir2 >> available
    ...
    
You can hope to find the latest version here:
