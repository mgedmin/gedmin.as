<h2>Lithuanian Time Zone</h2>

<p>The Lithuanian government likes to change time zones very much.
During the last three years (1998â€”2000) we had three changes.  In 2003 there was
another one.  If you have a slightly older Linux distribution, your
<em>Europe/Vilnius</em> time zone definition may be outdated (currently it
should be +0200 with +0300 daylight savings time in summer).  Then you will
need this package.
