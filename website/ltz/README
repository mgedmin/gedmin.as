This package contains updated Lithuanian time zone (Europe/Vilnius: from
2003 Lithuania will observe summer time again).

Files
-----

Europe/Vilnius      compiled time zone data
lithuania           this contains all required data to compile the updated
                    time zone


Checking
--------

To check if you need this update, type

  date --date 'jul 1 2003'

If you get

  Tue Jul  1 00:00:00 EEST 2003

everything is fine and your libc is recent enough.  If you get

  Tue Jul  1 00:00:00 EET 2003

instead, you need to apply this.


Installation
------------

Either overwrite your old Europe/Vilnius in /usr/share/zoneinfo or (better)
use `zic' to do that:

  # zic lithuania

You can then use `tzconfig' or a similair program to set you local time
zone to Europe/Vilnius.
